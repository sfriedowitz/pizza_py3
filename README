# Pizza (Py3)

A copy of the Pizza toolkit for LAMMPS (https://pizza.sandia.gov/), ported to Python 3. 
The port was done automatically,
and some features of the scripts and tools may be broken.

# Original Description
Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools written in
Python, many of which provide pre- and post-processing capability for
the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package.  There are tools to create
input files, convert between file formats, process log and dump files,
create plots, and visualize and animate simulation snapshots.
